                Each county has its own process, so we recommend contacting the
                traffic division of your local clerk’s office to confirm how
                they’d like you to submit your certificate (email, in person, or
                by mail).

                <b>A Friendly Reminder</b><br />
                It’s your responsibility to verify that this course is accepted
                by the organization requiring it (such as your court, DMV, or
                insurance company) and to make sure your certificate gets turned
                in on time.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-qs-answer">
             In order to assure prompt delivery and processing of your course completion certificate by court, you must follow these guidelines discussed below very carefully:
You must submit the Certificate of Course Completion and receipt directly to the courthouse. Sadly, the court does not permit traffic schools to submit Course Completion Certificates on behalf our students. This is, of course, designed to eliminate fraud in such cases where the court cannot be given adequate proof that the student seeking processing of his or her certificate actually completed the course, or otherwise is not able to verify his or her identity.
It is also imperative that sign in blue or black ink your Completion Certificate, as an unsigned Certificate of Course Completion will be considered invalid. Be sure to request a physical receipt after submitting the certificate in person. If you chose to send the certificate by certified mail, you will receive a document signifying that the courthouse duly received the document. You are to keep this receipt as proof of timely submission of the certificate, such as in the case that any issues arise.
While this may all seem like an administrative labyrinth and somewhat of a hassle, we strongly recommend working with the court and following each and every one of the steps we’ve outlined above, as this will create a win-win scenario when you can not only maintain a pristine driving record but also take advantage of low insurance premiums as well.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-qs-answer">
The course contains 11 short, easy-to-read chapters. Each chapter is followed by a short 5 question multiple choice quiz. When the quiz is passed, you will automatically move on to the next chapter.  
Customers must pass the quizzes with a score of at least 70%. All quizzes can be re-taken as many times as necessary free of charge.  
We stress the importance of the quizzes because the CA DMV mandate allows customers only 2 tries to pass the final exam. If a passing grade (70%) is not obtained by the 2nd final exam attempt your account will be locked out and you may re-enroll in this or a different traffic violator school course.

In addition, our course has barriers in place to prevent cheating and course material dissemination. These include regularly updating tests and quizzes, putting in technical barriers that disallow copy/pasting of material, and frequently ensuring no external party has published course answer keys.

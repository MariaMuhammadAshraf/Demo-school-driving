      <p class="faq-question">(1) I just received a ticket for unsafe driving. I’m worried my rates will go up. Will they?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer">
        It varies by state, but in most states taking a DMV-approved traffic school with their lesson in defensive driving can help reduce your insurance premium. We recommend traffic school as often as possible, except a court and should be used earlier for satisfaction purposes.
